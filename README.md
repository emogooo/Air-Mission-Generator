# Random Air Mission Generator

This project is a program designed for mission creators (Zeus) in the game Arma 3 to generate random air mission scenarios. Based on the provided interface, users can input the number of land and air missions. The program then randomly selects mission types such as Interdiction, Recon, SEAD Strike, Preplan CAS, Sweep, HAVCAP, and TARCAP, and generates a mission scenario accordingly. Each mission type comes with a brief description to help the mission creator understand the objective. This tool aims to streamline the mission creation process and add variety to the gameplay.
